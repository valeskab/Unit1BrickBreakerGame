Unit 1 Assignment: Scripting Basics and Brick Breaker Game

Project Objectives

Welcome to my "Brick Breaker Game" project! The main objectives I aim to achieve with this project are:

1. Learning Scripting Fundamentals: I want to showcase my grasp of scripting fundamentals by creating a brick breaker game using C# within the Unity game engine.

2. Applying Concepts: This project is a practical way for me to apply the scripting concepts I've learned in Unit 1. I will be implementing player controls, ball movement, and interactions with game elements.

3. Version Control Proficiency: Through the use of Git, I will demonstrate my ability to manage project development efficiently. I'll make proper commits and adhere to collaborative coding practices.

4. Asset Integration: Integrating assets I've created in Maya into the Unity project is a crucial part of this project. I want to ensure that these assets work seamlessly with the game mechanics.

Instructions for Reviewers

Thank you for taking the time to review my "Uber Casual Brick Breaker Game" project. Here's a guide to help you navigate through the project and understand its components:

1. Repository Structure

In the repository, you'll find the following structure:

- Assets: This folder holds all the game-related assets, including scripts, textures, and audio files.
- Scenes: The game scene is located here, where all the gameplay occurs.
- MayaAssets: This folder contains the assets I created in Maya, which I've integrated into the project.
- Documentation: Here, you'll find additional documents and resources related to the project.

2. Commits and Progress

I've documented my progress through Git commits:

- Initial Commit: This marks the start of the project with the basic folder structure.
- Player Controls Script: I've committed my progress as I implemented player controls.
- Ball Movement Script: Commits show the step-by-step development of ball movement mechanics.
- Brick Interactions Script: I've committed changes to script interactions and game logic.
- Maya Asset Integration: A commit showcases the successful integration of Maya assets.

3. Gameplay Instructions

- Objective: The goal of the game is to control the paddle and use it to bounce the ball, breaking all the bricks in the level.

- Controls: Players can use the left and right arrow keys or touch gestures to move the paddle horizontally and bounce the ball.

- Winning: Players win by breaking all the bricks and progressing to the next level.

- Losing: If the ball falls below the paddle, players lose a life. The game continues until all lives are used, and players can restart the level.

I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my "Brick Breaker Game" project. If you have any feedback or questions.
